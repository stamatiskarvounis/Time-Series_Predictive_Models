# Time-Series_Predictive_Models
Effectiveness of three time series forecasting techniques—SARIMA, RNN, and LSTM—in predicting long-term TMAX trends using historical climate data from 1980 to 2023. Utilizing the CRISP-DM methodology, we analyzed daily weather observations from the NOAA. ModThiels were assessed using MAE, RMSE, and MAPE metrics, and visualizations were employed
